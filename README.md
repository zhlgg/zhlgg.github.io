### <span id="Biography">Brief Bio</span>

Currently I am an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. Before that, I was a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University working with Professor Shiqiang Yang and Professor Peng Cui. I got my Ph.D. in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Tianjin University under the supervision of Prof. Xiaochun Cao in 2016. From Nov. 2014 to Nov. 2015, I visited Prof. Weixiong Zhang's group at Washington University in St. Louis as a visiting student. 

My current research interests include data mining, machine learning, and analysis of complex networks. In particular, I am interested in the network embedding, graph neural networks, community detection, as well as the network related applications.
